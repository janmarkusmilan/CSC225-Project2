# CSC225-Project2
Created an e-commerce store using Bootstrap 4 as a basis and incorporated the grid system from Bootstrap along with my own custom HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

The store includes:

    – A separate homepage with a hero and a gallery of products
    – A separate about page
    – A separate catalog page
    – A separate cart page
    – A separate check out page
    
Extra notes:

    – The site is responsive and looks good on tablet/mobile/desktop
    – The cart page has static products in the cart and is not driven based on the catalog page and user interaction with the site
    – The check out page is a form with validation that obtains all of the necessary information to fulfill the order
